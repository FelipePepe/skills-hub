## When to Use This Skill

- The user explicitly asks to close/save at the end of a session
- Significant work was done (deploy, feature, bugfix, architectural decision)
- The user says "let's wrap up", "save what matters", "summarize the session"
- Decisions/learnings are detected that are not in persistent memory

Do NOT use if:
- The session was trivial (a typo, a question without code)
- session-end was already run in this same turn

---

## Closing Protocol

### Step 1 — Review the Session History

Go through the conversation and identify candidates. For each one, decide the type:

| Type | Save if... |
|------|-----------|
| `decision` | Non-obvious architecture/technology/approach decision |
| `bugfix` | Resolved error — symptom, root cause, fix |
| `architecture` | Designed/documented structure (module, network, system) |
| `pattern` | Repeatable convention or way of working |
| `config` | Environment configuration (nginx, systemd, DNS, env vars) |
| `discovery` | Undocumented finding (occupied port, limitation, unexpected behavior) |

**Do NOT save**:
- Obvious steps or officially documented behavior
- Code already in the repo (the repo is the source of truth)
- Temporary state (in-progress tasks, TODOs without context)
- Things already in Engram/Atlas — verify first

### Step 2 — Classify Destination: Engram vs Atlas

Each candidate goes to ONE destination (not both unless there is an explicit reason).

**Atlas — persistent and architectural knowledge** (useful life >6 months, cross-session):
- Lives in `/mnt/nas/Obsidian/` (Obsidian vault). Primary access via filesystem (Read/Write/Edit) — the `atlas_*` MCP may not be available in every session.
- Structure: `Proyectos/<project>.md` (entity page per project), `Stack/<category>/<tech>.md` (tech reference with `_INDEX.md` master), `Setup/` (infra/operational), `AI/`, `Temp/`.
- "Load-bearing" architecture decisions: stack choice, data model, stable API contracts.
- Organizational conventions that apply across multiple projects.
- Canonical mappings (e.g. "MDASH↔vi-sdd", OWASP taxonomies).
- Established personal/team working patterns.

**Most typical at session close**: if there was a spec/phase close with architectural substance, **update `Proyectos/<project>.md`** with the delta (current state, metrics, new Stack links). This is usually not a new page — it is an upsert on the existing entity page. Mandatory convention: refresh the `**Last updated:** YYYY-MM-DD` field at the top.

**Engram — operational memory** (useful life weeks-months, day-to-day):
- Resolved bugs (symptom+cause+fix)
- Spec state and metrics (temporal snapshots)
- Specific environment configuration (venv, ports, paths)
- Prioritized technical debt
- Tactical decisions within a spec

**Quick rule**: if the answer to "will this still be true in 6 months?" is YES → atlas. If "it depends on the current state" → engram.

### Step 2.5 — Codebase Graph Freshness (codebase-memory-mcp)

Only if the `codebase-memory` MCP tools are available this session AND source files (not just docs/memory) were created, edited, or committed:

- `list_projects` — check whether this repo has ever been indexed.
  - Never indexed → skip this step entirely. Do not suggest indexing a project that has never used the graph.
- If previously indexed: `index_status` — compare the indexed commit against the current HEAD (post-commit, if you committed this session).
  - Behind HEAD → ask the user: "Codebase graph is N commits behind — re-index with `index_repository`? (may take a while on large repos)"
  - Only run `index_repository` if the user confirms. Never re-index automatically — same caution as the Tests/Benchmark step in `session-start`.
  - Up to date → nothing to do, no need to mention it.

### Step 3 — Check for Duplicates Before Saving

For each candidate:

- Engram: `mem_search("<title or keywords>", project=<X>)`. If something similar exists: use `topic_key` to upsert with `mem_save` or `mem_update`.
- Atlas: check if `Proyectos/<project>.md` exists in `/mnt/nas/Obsidian/`. If yes → edit the relevant section (do not create a new page). If the observation spans several projects or concerns a technology, consider `Stack/<category>/<tech>.md`. Last resort: create a new page — only if the topic genuinely does not fit any existing one.

`topic_key` values (Engram) must be stable and compound: `vi-sdd/spec-006-owasp`, `homelab/nginx-config`, `personal/git-workflow`.

### Step 4 — Save with Canonical Structure

Mandatory format for `content` (engram and atlas):

```
**What**: [what was done or decided, in one line]
**Why**: [why it matters, what problem it solves]
**Where**: [paths, files, commands, affected services]
**Learned**: [gotchas, edge cases, decisions made — omit if not applicable]
```

**Titles**: short, searchable, prefixed by project when applicable.
- ✅ `vi-sdd: dedup command-injection-sink (spec 006 phase 8)`
- ✅ `homelab: nginx on pihole2 - reload without restart`
- ❌ `fixed a problem with nginx`

**Common projects**: `homelab`, `poc-trello`, `openclaw`, `sdd-office`, `vi-sdd`, `engram`.
**Personal scope** (preferred for infra and patterns that apply across projects): `scope: personal`.

Run saves in parallel when they are independent (multiple `mem_save` in a single turn).

### Step 5 — Project Journal (if applicable)

If the project has `docs/journal/sessions/` and the session was substantial (not trivial):

- Check if an entry for today already exists: `docs/journal/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- If it does NOT exist and the session warrants an entry: **ask the user** before creating it
  - Template at `docs/journal/sessions/_template.md` if it exists
  - Minimum content: objective, work done, decisions, bugs found, quantified result, state at close
- If it already exists: ask whether to append the advances from this turn
- Do NOT create the journal automatically — always confirm

If the project does NOT have `docs/journal/` → skip this step.

### Step 6 — Summary to User

Display a table of what was saved:


| Destination | Title / Page | Type | Action |
|-------------|-------------|------|--------|
| Engram | ... | bugfix | save |
| Engram | ... | decision | update (#1234) |
| Atlas | `Proyectos/vi-sdd.md` | architecture | edit (section X) |
| Atlas | `Stack/Languages/Rust.md` | pattern | edit (section Y) |

And briefly mention what was decided NOT to save and why (e.g. "trivial", "already in X").

If a journal was created/modified: include the file path.
If the codebase graph was re-indexed (Step 2.5): mention the new indexed commit; if it was flagged stale but the user declined to re-index, note that it's still pending.

---

## Operational Rules

- **Do not invent** observations — only save what actually happened in the conversation.
- **Do not duplicate** — always run `mem_search`/`atlas_search` first. Upsert with `topic_key`.
- **Parallelism**: independent saves go in the same turn.
- **Atlas-first**: when in doubt, default to Atlas. Only use Engram if the candidate is clearly temporal/tactical (a snapshot tied to current state, a resolved bug, a spec metric) per the Step 2 table.
- **Respect project language**: if the project's CLAUDE.md is in Spanish, titles and content go in Spanish too.
- **Do not silence errors**: if engram/atlas fails, report to the user what was left pending.

## Quick Heuristics

**Is this worth saving?**
- Would you search for this in memory next time you do the same thing? → Yes → save
- Did it take >15 min to resolve or understand? → Yes → save
- Is it something you could forget in 2 weeks? → Yes → save
- Is it already in the code, CLAUDE.md, or docs/? → No → don't save

**Engram or Atlas?**
- "The vi-sdd OWASP catalog maps 19 bug_classes to 7 categories" → atlas (stable taxonomy)
- "Spec 006 closed on May 21 with F1 0.998 and 317 tests" → engram (temporal snapshot)
- "To avoid duplicates, the command-injection-sink dedup omits the symbol" → engram (tactical decision)
- "We use a 6-stage pipeline architecture inspired by MDASH" → atlas (architectural decision)

**Create a journal?**
- Session <30min with no substantial changes → no
- Session with new bug fix, decision, or closed phase → yes (ask first)
- Conversation/analysis only without code → no, but update memory

## Compatibility

This skill **replaces** the old `engram-fin-sesion`. If the user invokes that by name, this skill covers the same trigger and adds Atlas + journal.
