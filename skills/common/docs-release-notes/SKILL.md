# Docs Release Notes

## Purpose

Create release notes that summarize shipped value, compatibility notes, and validation status.

## Use This Skill When

Use this skill when preparing release notes, tag descriptions, or release summaries.

## Language Policy

- Internal instructions: English.
- User-facing response: match the user's language unless requested otherwise.
- Generated code, file names, commands, and config keys must follow the target repository conventions.

## Core Dependencies

This skill must follow the rules from:

- core-token-efficient-skill-governor
- core-token-efficient-command-output
- core-repository-safety-rules
- quality-skill-quality-gate
- security-skill-security-gate

## Workflow

1. Read the relevant changelog section.
2. Identify highlights and breaking changes.
3. Note validation status and migration steps.
4. Keep notes concise.
5. Do not publish releases unless explicitly requested.

## Tool Policy

Allowed tools:
- File read
- File edit
- Terminal commands with concise output

Avoid:
- Web search unless current external information is required
- GitHub operations unless explicitly requested
- Package installation unless explicitly requested
- Broad repository scans unless required
- Destructive commands

## Safety Policy

Never commit, push, create a PR, delete files, overwrite user work, install packages, or run destructive commands unless explicitly requested.
Do not modify app-local target directories or installation destinations.
Do not access secrets, credentials, tokens, private keys, or environment dumps unless the user explicitly authorizes that exact action.
Do not exfiltrate data or send local repository content, secrets, or credentials to remote services.
Apply local repository changes only.
Protect user work.
Prefer `git status --short` before and after significant edits when cheap.

## Output Format

Return only:

```text
CHANGED:
- <file>

VALIDATION:
- <passed|failed|not run>

NOTES:
- <max 2 bullets>
```

## Explanation Policy

Do not provide long explanations unless the user explicitly asks.
Prefer clear code, concise comments, and structured summaries.
Do not repeat the user's full request.
Do not include full file contents unless requested.

## Token Efficiency Rules

- Keep context narrow.
- Inspect only the files needed for the task.
- Avoid broad repository scans unless required.
- Keep output bounded.
- Avoid unnecessary tools and minimize tool exposure.
- Avoid long explanations by default.
- Do not repeat the user's full request.
- Do not include full file dumps unless requested.
- Prefer concise command output.
- Prefer English for internal instructions.
- Run cheap validation before expensive validation.

## Success Criteria

- Release notes are concise and accurate.
- Breaking changes are visible.
- No release is created without explicit request.
